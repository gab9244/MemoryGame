 <h2>Why a memory game?</h2>
 <p>I chose this project because I wanted to improve my skills with arrays and put to work some of the basics, like map and sort functions.</p>

 <h2>What i learn</h2>
 <p>With this project, I learned how to use useEffect and how to use map to create elements and add values dynamically. There are some minor things, like using CurrentTarget, but overall, I improved my problem-solving skills.</p>
